description=[h1]Notes[/h1]
description=[code]
description=- Last Tested on Build 41.78
description=- The toggle lights function works just like manually activating the switch. (Synced to sever)
description=- Light shows on MP operate entirely in client, using the server only to pass the parameters of the light show and indicate when it's paused, resumed, or stopped. This keeps the mod light weight for large pop servers.
description=- Light shows timeout after 5 minutes.
